The A/E results are determined without the application of improvement\nfactors.\n\nMultiple factors contribute to fluctuations in mortality experience over time, including overall population mortality\nimprovement/deterioration, changes in underwriting and policy size, changes in the average age and duration, and\nchanges in issuing companies. This report will explore and update some of these items.\n\nThe first step in this process was an exhaustive data validation effort. Although the ILEC always reviews the data for\nconsistency and integrity, this was particularly thorough as a result of changing the statistical agent from Medical\nInformation Bureau (MIB) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Additional details of the\ndata validation process are included in Section 2, Section 8, and the exhibits included with this report.\n\nThe analysis begins with a high-level review of A/E trends by age, sex, face, and smoker class. These trends are\nreviewed in more detail by product group, risk class and older age experience in separate sections of this report.\n\nFinally, included with this report are additional resources that actuaries can use to reproduce the results in this\nreport and perform additional analysis using their own tools.

The data from observation years 2012-2017 from the\nprior ILEC study have been appended to the 2018-2019 experience data to create a composite dataset for the study\nperiod, 2012-2019. The committee removed data from observation years 2009-2011 as they were more limited and\nless consistent with later years. Also, the observation year 2018 data is now complete and included. The lack of\nsufficient 2018 data necessitated omitting it from the previous report.\n\nOne notable change from earlier reports is that the NAIC now serves as the statistical agent for data collection, the\nrole formerly held by the MIB. While data are broadly consistent between the two agents, this change has led to\nsome differences in the company data included, among other things. The 2018-19 data contains 16 more companies\nthan the 2016-17 data and 9% more overall exposure. About 12% of the 2018-19 exposure and 10% of the claims\noriginate from companies not in the 2016-17 data.\n\nAs with the prior ILEC studies, this report examines mortality under standard individually underwritten life insurance\nand excludes joint, rated, converted, and guaranteed or simplified issue business. For the data underlying this\nreport, the ILEC has relied upon the data integrity of the individual company submissions and the data validation\nperformed by the statistical agent on behalf of those companies and regulators. It should be noted that the\ndefinition of \u201csimplified issue\u201d has become increasingly blurred in recent years and may not be consistent across\ncompanies. The data include only direct written business in the U.S.; no assumed reinsurance business is included.\n\nThe calendar-year method used exposure formulas consistent with the Balducci assumption. This approach is\ncommonly used in the industry for life insurance mortality studies, and the Balducci assumption is used for\nconvenience in tabulating exposures. This may produce counter-intuitive results in some situations, but these\nsituations tend to occur with limited exposures.\n\nExcept where noted otherwise, the expected mortality basis used in calculating Actual-to-Expected (A/E) ratios in\nthis report are the 2015 Valuation Basic Table (2015 VBT), RR 100. Life insurance writers in the U.S. issue policies on\nan Age Last Birthday (ALB) basis and an Age Nearest Birthday (ANB) basis. The calculation of A/E ratios utilized the\nexpected table version consistent with how the company indicated that its data was organized.\n\nSimilarly, the application of smoker-distinct versus composite (\u2018unismoke\u2019) tables relied on the indication made by\nthe submitting company. However, composite tables were used as the expected basis for all policies issued before\n1981, regardless of smoking status indicated, as the ILEC believes smoking as a distinct rating factor was rare before\nthat time. When smoker-distinct rates were first introduced, the smoking status field was added to databases. Many\ncompanies filled in this field for their entire portfolio of previously issued composite smoking policies as smokers,\nwhile others defaulted all that business to non-smokers.\n\nA/E ratios in this report are reported on an amount basis unless noted otherwise. Users should be aware of\ndifferences in results on an amount basis versus a count basis and the volatility associated with each measure.\nUnless otherwise noted, references to claim counts are on a by-policy basis."

Many companies submitting data in this process were new to the\nprocess of such data submissions. Ultimately, responsibility for data accuracy is placed on the individual company\nsubmitters, and the ILEC has relied on that process for the accuracy of its data. Further information about this\nprocess and impact on the results can be found in Section 8, Reliances and Limitations.\n\nThe ILEC carefully evaluated the data quality of the 2018-2019 experience data received from the NAIC. Since this\nwas the first time that we received data from the NAIC as the new statistical agent, we wanted to know whether and\nto what extent the newer data was consistent with or diverged from the prior data. Three different approaches to\ntesting the data were performed: a traditional review of the ILEC data consistency, an approach using predictive\nanalytics, and a comparison of insured population mortality improvement with general population experience.\n\nOverall, there did not appear to be unexpected differences between the MIB and NAIC datasets from an exposure\nperspective by count or amount. While there were some shifts in marginal distributions of exposures, the\ninterdependencies of the exposures either changed very little or changed in ways that were expected.\n\n2.2.1 ILEC DATA CONSISTENCY\n\nThis subcommittee explored the consistency of the data for the years 2018-19 with the data from 2016-17 (e.g., the\nfirst two years of the NAIC data with last two years of experience from MIB) by comparing the results shown in the\n\nappendices available for download with this report\n. The review was performed using two filters: the data for all\n\ncompanies in 2016-17 compared to the data for all companies in 2018-19 and the common companies for those\nfour years.\n\nAn exact set of common companies was not available because we could not obtain a subset of the MIB data for\n2016-17 with only the companies that also submitted data to the NAIC in 2018-19. However, the NAIC was able to\nadd a flag to the data in 2018-19 to indicate if it was from a company that had also submitted data to MIB in 2016-\n17. The volume of experience for the MIB companies in the NAIC data from 2018-19 was within 2% of the volume of\ndata for all MIB companies in 2016-17. We concluded that the NAIC data from companies that had also submitted\ndata to MIB in 2016-17 was a reasonable proxy for a common company comparison with the MIB data from 2016-\n17.\n\nEach volunteer on the committee reviewed a selection of the appendices, comparing results for all companies from\nMIB 2016-17 with all companies from the NAIC 2018-19, and separately with the common companies\u2019 proxy. The\nprimary metric of comparison was the A/E ratio for each cell in the appendix, and any substantial differences were\nnoted. Claim counts and amounts were also considered where a material difference in A/E ratio was observed. Any\nsubstantive issues determined in the data were addressed; any known remaining issues observed in the data have\nbeen noted and included in Section 8.\n\nAs a final check, the committee volunteers also compared the NAIC data for 2018-19 with the MIB data from 2012-\n17 by year. We concluded that the NAIC 2018-19 data was consistent with the previous MIB data, and that any\nobserved differences were minor or explainable based on known changes in methodology.\n\n2.2.2 PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS\n\nThe committee explored applying predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to search for and describe\ndifferences between the data received from the NAIC and MIB. Exploration was carried out in collaboration with\ndata scientists at the NAIC. Our goal was to assess the differences for two aspects of the data: the distribution of\nexposures and the mortality outcomes."

Methods from other areas of statistics, artificial intelligence (AI), and\nmachine learning (ML) were rejected for want of transparency, model richness, or feasibility (as in the case of many\nAI/ML models). Overall, some differences were found in the distribution when moving from the MIB data source to\nthe NAIC data source. However, the majority of the differences are explained by the intensive data quality\nimprovement efforts undertaken by the NAIC.\n\nFor mortality outcomes, we used gradient-boosted decision trees. The source of the data, MIB versus NAIC, was set\nas a predictor variable. The outputs of interest were single-variable feature importance and feature importance for\ntwo-way interactions. In general, the source of the data had predictive power similar to random noise, and\ninteractions with other variables showed that there were minor subsets of the data where mortality clearly differed\nby source. Excluding these small, distinguished subsets, mortality patterns appeared similar across data sources.\n\nDetails of the methodologies, findings, and technical information are contained in\n \nExhibit 1 included with this\n\nreport\n.

The idea was that the ILEC change in mortality should be similar in magnitude and\ndirection to the population MI. While there are many reasons why the population MI is not an exact predictor of\nILEC mortality movement, it was considered a valid sense check. Using actuarial judgement, the group decided that\nany deviation beyond approximately 3% for each of the calendar years 2018 and 2019 would warrant further\ninvestigation.\n\nGiven the substantial basis risk of using population MI as a proxy for this specific movement, the team deemed it\nappropriate to use the movement as a general sense check, but not to specifically hypothesis test whether to accept\nor reject the new results. Additionally, due to the imperfect nature of the proxy, the comparison was kept at the\naggregate level.

The gap between the two curves is explained by the mortality gradient by\nsocioeconomic class, for which face amount size is a proxy, and different underwriting standards. That is,\nhigher socioeconomic classes have lighter mortality and higher face amounts compared to lower\nsocioeconomic classes. The A/E by Count curve gives equal weights to all policies regardless of the size.\nSince there are fewer large policies, the average is more representative of the experience for lower face\namount bands.

As a result, significant\njudgment has been required for estimating older age mortality experience for the insured population. This section\nexamines mortality trends for older age groups and interactions across various risk characteristics. Previous analysis\non older age mortality can be found in the\n \nSOA\u2019s 2022 Old Age Mortality Experience Study Report\n.\n\nWe first examine A/E results of the core dataset by observation year for five-year attained age groupings by count\nand amount.

Almost all observations of A/Es by amount are lower than A/E by count,\nconfirming that lower face amount bands are experiencing worse mortality.\n\n\u2022\n \nA/Es by count for ages 70-84 appear to be trending down over time. A similar trend for A/Es by amount is\nobservable for these ages.\n\n\u2022\n \nA/Es by count for ages 85-94 appear to have a fairly flat pattern over the observation period, which\nsuggests limited mortality improvement at extreme old ages. A/Es by amount for the same groups are\nmore volatile, as large claims have an outsized impact.\n\nWe can attempt to control for some of the expected factors driving observed differences by presenting a separate\nview of experience using the modern dataset, reflecting changes in product design and the rise of more granular\nunderwriting practices described previously.

Those data submissions were facilitated and coordinated by the NAIC. VM-50 Section 2.B.2 designated the\nNAIC as the Experience Reporting Agent for the Statistical Plan for Mortality beginning January 1, 2020.\n\nThe NAIC, on behalf of the Missouri Department of Insurance, worked with each company independently to validate\nand verify the accuracy of their data submissions. Many companies submitting data in this process were new to the\nprocess of such data submissions. Ultimately, responsibility for data accuracy is placed on the individual company\nsubmitters, and the ILEC has relied on that process for the accuracy of its data.\n\n8.1 2018 AND 2019 OBSERVATION YEARS\n\nThe following items are notable regarding the data for the 2018 and 2019 observation years:\n\n1.\n \nMany companies received feedback from the NAIC regarding inconsistencies in the coding of smoker status\nand preferred class fields, and final data submissions reflected many corrections. However, this is an area\nwhere additional changes will be seen for future observation years (see item 2 below). A clearly defined risk\nclass structure from VM-51 must be present, meaning that if the preferred class structure indicator=1 (i.e.,\nthere are preferred classes), then the smoker / non-smoker preferred class structure fields must match the\nsmoker status. In cases where the coding is inconsistent, the risk class structure is mapped to an Unknown\ncategory. The examples below illustrate cases of data inconsistencies.\n\n\u2022\n \nExample #1 \u2013 The record is coded inconsistently as follows:\n\nPreferred Class Structure Indicator = 1 (there are preferred classes)\n\nSmoker Status = Cigarette Smoker\n\nNumber of Classes in Nonsmoker Preferred Class Structure = 3\n\nNonsmoker Preferred Class = 1\n\nIn this example, Smoker preferred class fields should have been populated instead of the Nonsmoker\npreferred class fields. Mapping to an Unknown category will allow these types of inconsistencies to be\nmonitored over time and they are expected to decline as companies improve their processes.\n\n\u2022\n \nExample #2:\n\nSome companies indicated that they issue Unismoke business with preferred class structures. A\nlimitation of VM-51 is that there are no Unismoke preferred class fields. As a result, it is unclear how to\ncode these policies and companies have taken different approaches. The most common is to assign an\nUnknown smoker status and populate the Nonsmoker preferred class structure fields. The NAIC\nmapped these records to the Unknown category, but unlike the previous example, a Valuation Manual\namendment would be needed to allow companies to correctly classify this business."

As a result, the trend of some\ndata fields will change for the 2020 and/or 2021 observation years versus the 2018 and 2019 observation\nyears. The NAIC\u2019s review of data submissions for the 2020 and 2021 observation years (which is still in\nprogress), indicates the changes are mainly in two areas:\n\n\u2022\n \nType of Underwriting Requirements\n\nFor the 2018 and 2019 observation years, some companies coded most of their records as\nunderwriting type 01 (Underwritten, but unknown whether fluid was collected). The NAIC asked\nwhether this could be refined to split records into underwriting type 02 (Underwritten with no fluid\ncollection) and/or type 03 (Underwritten with fluid collected) where appropriate. Companies generally\nresponded that this was possible but would require a project to get the information from an\nunderwriting database. A number of companies completed this work recently and reflected the results\nin their 2020 and/or 2021 data submissions.\n\n\u2022\n \nPreferred Class Structure Fields\n\nAs noted under item 1 above, the 2018 and 2019 data included inconsistencies in the coding of smoker\nstatus and preferred class structure fields. A number of companies have made improvements in this\narea for the 2020 and/or 2021 observation years.\n\n3.\n \nPreferred Risk Class exposures are in the data for issue years prior to 1990. Where this was observed, the\nNAIC asked companies to verify the accuracy of the data. Many confirmed they issued business under a\npreferred class structure in the 1980\u2019s. However, as noted in this report, we have chosen to exclude these\nexposures from any preferred class analysis.\n\n4.\n \nPaid-Up Additions (PUAs) and One-Year Term (OYT) records are part of the mandatory data submissions.\nFor the 2018 and 2019 observation years, these records were not easy to identify separately. However, a\nVM-51 amendment reflected in the 2023 version of the Valuation Manual added new plan codes to identify\nPUA and OYT records. The use of these plan codes is required beginning with the 2021 observation year.\nCompanies were encouraged to use these plan codes on a voluntary basis for the 2020 observation year,\nand some did so. It is expected that the experience at the lowest face amount bands will be impacted by\nthe presence of these records.\n\n5.\n \nFor observation years 2019 and prior, juvenile records (issue ages < 18) were assigned qx's based on the\n2015 M/F Unismoke VBT table (SOA #3274). However, it is important to note that the data retains the\nreporting of smoker status provided by the company. Some companies indicated that they have issued\nsmoker/nonsmoker business prior to issue age 18.\n\n6.\n \nData records with face amounts at or above $100,000 and early policy durations contained an Unknown\nsmoker status. The impact on overall results should be minimal, but the user should be aware of this in\nmore refined analysis. In many cases, these records represent policies issued to juveniles. Where the NAIC\nobserved large face amounts for juveniles, companies were asked to verify the accuracy of the data. Based\non their responses, it appears this is not unusual. Also, some of these records may represent policies issued\non a Unismoke basis."

These are discussed below.\n\n1.\n \nConsistency of Participating Companies\n\nFor observation years 2017 and prior, year-over-year consistency of the companies participating in data\ncalls was not assured. This changed beginning with the 2018 observation year when VM-50 and VM-51\nrequirements went into effect. The NAIC selected participating companies according to criteria outlined in\nVM-51 Section 2.C. with a target to achieve at least 85% of industry claims experience for life insurance\nbusiness in scope. All companies selected to submit mortality experience data are expected to continue\nreporting their experience in future years, barring circumstances justifying an exemption. This is intended\nto ensure consistency of participating companies.\n\nTo help ensure substantial consistency of participants for the 2018 and 2019 observation years versus\nrecent prior observation years, 78 of the 107 selected companies were \u201ccommon companies,\u201d meaning\nthat they were participants in the Kansas or New York data calls prior to the 2018 observation year. The\nremaining 29 selected companies were new participants starting with the 2018 observation year.\n\n2.\n \nImprovement in Usable Data\n\nFor observation years 2017 and prior, data from some participating companies was entirely excluded due\nto data quality concerns. Due to Valuation Manual requirements, this is no longer the case beginning with\nthe 2018 observation year. VM-50 Section 4.B.11 requires the NAIC to identify \u201ccritical indications\u201d and\nreport these to each company. These are defined as indications that, if not corrected or confirmed, would\nleave a significant degree of doubt whether the affected data should be used in reports to the state\ninsurance regulator and included in industry databases.\n\nNAIC staff identified both critical and non-critical indications and provided this feedback to companies. VM-\n50 Section 4.B.13 states the responsibility of companies to respond:\n\n\u201cCompanies shall acknowledge and respond to reasonability queries from the Experience\nReporting Agent. This shall include specific responses to all critical indications provided by the\nExperience Reporting Agent. Other indications shall be studied for apparent errors, as well as\nfor indications of systematic errors. Corrections for critical indications shall be provided to the\nExperience Reporting Agent or, when a correction is not feasible, the extent and nature of the\nerror shall be reported to the Experience Reporting Agent.\u201d\n\nFor the 2018 and 2019 observation years, data from all participating companies was provided to the ILEC.\nThis was achieved because companies resubmitted data and/or provided responses to questions until the\nNAIC considered the data provided to the ILEC to be acceptable for each individual company. Companies\nalso signed off on the reasonableness of A/E ratios that the NAIC calculated based on their data. For future\nobservation years, the NAIC expects that data from all participants will continue to be included in the\naggregated data files provided to the ILEC."

The remaining 29 companies were not included for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022\n \nRequirement that Companies be Licensed in Missouri\n\nVM-50 Section 3.B.3 states that \u201cthe NAIC will seek to enter into agreements with a group of state\ninsurance departments for the collection of information under statistical plans included in VM-51. The\nnumber of states that contract with the Experience Reporting Agent will be based on achieving a target\nlevel of industry experience prescribed by VM-51 for each line of business in preparing an industry\nexperience table.\u201d The NAIC entered into an agreement with the Missouri Department of Insurance,\nwhich achieves the target level of industry experience under VM-51. Since this agreement only covers\ncompanies licensed in Missouri, those not licensed there were excluded. These were all small\ncompanies.\n\n\u2022\n \nOut of Scope Business\n\nVM-50 requires companies to reconcile their data submission against company financial data. This\nserves as a control to demonstrate that only business in scope was submitted. As a result, it was\ndetermined that data provided by some companies as part of the New York data call was out of scope\nfor VM-51 data collection. These companies were, therefore, excluded from the NAIC data collection.\nIt is important to note that the New York and NAIC data calls are not identical. New York collects data\nthat is out of scope for VM-51 (e.g., Guaranteed Issue).\n\n\u2022\n \nExemptions\n\nFor some companies, the data remaining after removing out of scope business was very small. These\ncompanies were granted exemptions from data collection.\n\n\u2022\n \nSmall Companies\n\nVM-51 allows a group of companies to exempt an affiliate from data collection if the affiliate\u2019s\npremium is less than $10 million. Nearly all groups elected to do this. Additional exemptions are also\nallowed, and several were granted.\n\n\u2022\n \nAssumed Business\n\nAnother scope difference relates to reinsurance. In discussions with some companies, it was\ndetermined that for the New York and Kansas data calls, data for business assumed from other\ncompanies was submitted along with direct written business. The NAIC instructed these companies to\nsubmit only their own direct written business, since business assumed is out of scope under VM-51.\n\n4.\n \nNew Controls Required by VM-50 Beginning with the 2018 Observation Year\n\nVM-50 prescribes several new controls that may not have been required for companies submitting data\nprior to 2018. These are described below.\n\n\u2022\n \nControl Totals\n\nVM-50 Section 4.B.2 requires each submission of data to be balanced against a set of control totals\nprovided by the company. At a minimum, these control totals shall include applicable record counts,"

To assist with the reporting of control totals, NAIC\nstaff developed a template companies could use. Although use of this template is not prescribed in the\nValuation Manual, nearly all companies elected to use it. The purpose of the control totals is to ensure\nthat the NAIC received a complete file and that the numbers match what the company intended to\nsend.\n\n\u2022\n \nData Reconciliation\n\nVM-50 Section 4.B.3 requires each company to perform a reconciliation between the data submitted\nand the company\u2019s statistical and financial data and provide an explanation of differences. To assist\nwith this, NAIC staff developed a template companies could use to reconcile against the Exhibit of Life\nInsurance. Although use of this template is not prescribed in the Valuation Manual, nearly all\ncompanies elected to use it. The purpose of this reconciliation is to ensure that all in-scope business\nhas been included in the data file, and that no out-of-scope business was submitted.\n\n5.\n \nTreatment of Records in Segments 2 and Higher\n\nSegment 2 typically represents PUAs, spouse or child riders, or term riders. The treatment of records in\nsegments 2 and higher is materially different for the 2018 and 2019 observation years versus prior\nobservation years. The previous approach did not distinguish between base segment 1 and segments 2+.\nFor segments 2+, the face amount was added to the base segment, and the demographics of the base\nsegment were used (issue date, issue age, gender).\n\nData for observation years 2018 and 2019 are separated for segment 1 versus segments 2+. Segments 2+\nare rolled up by issue age and gender. The policy exposed indicator is set to 0, so the face amount is\ncounted but there is no additional policy count.\n\n6.\n \nFor observation years prior to 2018, it was determined that the 2015 VBT Unismoke tables had incorrect qx\nrates for ages 96 and older. The qx values for ages 96 through 99 were the issue age 95, duration 2+, select\nrates rather than the ultimate rates at age 96+. This was corrected for observation years 2018 and 2019."
