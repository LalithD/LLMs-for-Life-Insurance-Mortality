        "insight": "Based on the provided graph of Actual-to-Expected (A/E) ratios by amount and the ILEC data dictionary, here is an analysis of the trends, segment insights, and an evaluation of your hypothesis.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Trends and New Insights\n\n*   **Persistent Performance Gap:** The most striking insight is the consistent and significant vertical distance between the two lines. The ULSG A/E ratio fluctuates between approximately 0.82 and 0.88, while the UL ratio sits much higher, generally between 0.96 and 1.07. This suggests that the underlying risk profiles of these two \"Universal Life\" products are fundamentally different, despite sharing a common name.\n*   **Correlation of Volatility:** Interestingly, the peaks and valleys for both segments largely mirror each other (e.g., the sharp dip in 2014 and the recovery in 2015). This indicates that both segments are being influenced by the same \"exogenous\" factors\u2014likely a combination of broader population mortality fluctuations in those years and systemic reporting/valuation shifts within the ILEC data collection itself.\n*   **Stabilization vs. Improvement:** While ULSG shows a very slight downward (improving) trend from 2012 to 2019, UL appears to have \"flatlined\" after an initial drop between 2012 and 2014. UL is essentially hovering around the 1.00 mark, meaning its mortality is tracking almost exactly with the VBT 2015 table, whereas ULSG is significantly outperforming the table.\n\n### 2. Speculation on Mortality Drivers\n\n**Why ULSG remains lower (Superior Performance):**\n*   **Socio-Economic Selection:** ULSG is often a \"high-ticket\" estate planning tool. Looking at the `Face_Amount_Band` in your dictionary, ULSG policies often cluster in the higher bands (08\u201311). Higher face amounts are a known proxy for higher socio-economic status, which correlates with better access to healthcare and lower mortality.\n*   **Underwriting Intensity:** Because ULSG carries significant long-term guarantees, carriers historically applied more rigorous medical underwriting compared to older UL products, leading to a \"cleaner\" block of business.\n*   **Target Market:** The \"modernization\" you mentioned often involves target markets that are more insurance-literate and proactive about health management.\n\n**Why UL remains higher (Elevated Mortality):**\n*   **Anti-Selection and Policy Decay:** As UL policies from the 1980s and 90s age, healthy lives often surrender their policies or exchange them (1035 exchange) for newer, more efficient products (like ULSG). Those who are in poor health are more likely to keep their older UL policies active at any cost\u2014a classic case of mortality anti-selection.\n*   **The \"Uni-Smoke\" Factor:** Your data dictionary notes that `Smoker_Status` is set to \"Uni-smoke\" for `Issue_Year < 1981`. Older UL blocks likely contain many \"unsmoker\" or aggregate-rated lives. These lack the mortality advantages of the modern dynamic \"Preferred Non-Smoker\" classes found in ULSG.\n*   **Lapse-Supported Pricing Issues:** Older UL policies without secondary guarantees are sensitive to interest rates. As rates stayed low, premiums rose, causing \"healthy\" lapses, leaving behind a \"frail\" residual population.\n\n### 3. Comment on Your Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis:** *The gap between UL and ULSG A/E ratios will widen over time due to ULSG modernization and UL anti-selection/wear-off.*\n\n**Evaluation:** Your hypothesis is **partially supported** by the visual evidence, but with a nuance regarding the *velocity* of the widening.\n\n*   **The Gap Exists:** You are correct that the gap is wide and UL remains elevated.\n*   **Widening Trend:** If we compare 2012 (gap of ~0.20) to 2017/2018 (gap of ~0.17), the gap hasn't necessarily \"widened\" in a linear fashion; it has actually remained remarkably stable.\n*   **Refinement:** The \"widening\" might be masked by the fact that the oldest, most anti-selective UL policies are finally rolling off the books (dying out) or hitting their `Attained_Age` limits (e.g., age 95 or 121), which stabilizes the A/E ratio. \n\n**Conclusion:** The data confirms that UL and ULSG should be treated as distinct risk classes for pricing and reserving. The \"wear-off\" you suspected is visible in the sense that UL cannot break below the 0.95 barrier, whereas ULSG enjoys the benefits of modern underwriting and a wealthier policyholder base."

Commentary on the Hypothesis\n**Hypothesis:** *Males will show a faster rate of mortality improvement (steeper decline in A/E) in high face amount bands compared to females.*\n\n**Evaluation:** The data **partially supports** this hypothesis, but with significant nuance regarding volatility.\n*   **Male Improvement:** Looking at the Male segment for Band 05 ($100k-$250k, grey line), there is a very clear, consistent downward slope from ~1.05 to ~0.96. The higher bands (08-11) for males show even steeper declines, though they are much more volatile.\n*   **Female Improvement:** Female trends (e.g., Band 05, dark blue line) appear \"flatter\" or more stable. While the Female Band 05 shows a slight downward trend, the slope is less aggressive than the Male counterpart.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Male \"high-face\" segments (Bands 09-11) end the 2019 period at lower A/E ratios than they started in 2012, whereas many female segments end nearly where they began, supporting the idea of faster male improvement in \"Modern\" underwriting.\n\n---\n\n### 2. New Insights & Observed Trends\n\n#### A. The \"Volatility Cliff\" in Jumbo Policies (Bands 10 & 11)\nThe most striking feature of the graph is the extreme volatility in the $5M\u2013$10M+ segments (Bands 10 and 11). \n*   **Insight:** For both genders, the A/E ratio for Band 11 fluctuates wildly (e.g., Male Band 11 drops from nearly 1.0 to 0.6 in one year). \n*   **Reasoning:** This is likely due to **low exposure (credibility issue)**. In ultra-high face amount bands, a single death claim can drastically spike the A/E ratio, while a year with zero deaths among a small pool of \"jumbo\" policyholders causes the plummeting valleys seen in 2013 and 2014.\n\n#### B. The Converging \"Sweet Spot\" ($1M - $2.5M)\nBand 08 (Red/Light Blue lines) shows a converging trend toward an A/E of approximately 0.75\u20130.80 for both genders by 2019. \n*   **Insight:** This segment appears to be the \"Goldilocks\" zone where underwriting is rigorous enough to select for high-quality risks, but the data pool is large enough to avoid the extreme volatility of the $10M+ bands.\n*   **Reasoning:** This likely reflects the success of **Preferred Underwriting** programs which became standard in \"Modern\" policies for these amounts, effectively filtering out sub-standard mortality risks.\n\n#### C. Male Mortality Premium at Lower Face Amounts\nThere is a persistent gap where Male Band 05 ($100k-$250k) consistently sits at the highest A/E ratio on the chart (near 1.0).\n*   **Insight:** Despite a downward trend, lower-face-amount males consistently underperform (higher mortality relative to expectations) compared to all female bands and higher-face male bands.\n*   **Reasoning:** This suggests a **socioeconomic correlation**. Smaller face amounts often correlate with less rigorous medical underwriting (e.g., simplified issue or less frequent fluid testing) and potentially lower socioeconomic status, which is a known driver of higher mortality.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Speculations on Mortality Drivers\n\n#### Why we see Lower-than-Expected Mortality (A/E < 1.0):\n1.  **Selection Effect (Underwriting):** The \"Modern\" dataset relies heavily on blood chemistry, physical exams, and prescription history. High-face policies (Bands 07+) require the most stringent checks, which explains why their A/E ratios are generally lower than Band 05.\n2.  **Affluence/Socioeconomic Status:** Policyholders who can afford $2.5M+ in coverage typically have better access to healthcare, better nutrition, and safer occupations/living environments.\n3.  **The \"Lapse\" Effect:** Healthy individuals are more likely to keep their policies, while those in financial distress (who also have higher mortality risks) may let policies lapse, though this effect is usually secondary to underwriting.\n\n#### Why we see Higher-than-Expected Mortality or Lack of Improvement:\n1.  **Anti-Selection in Females:** If female mortality is \"flatter\" across face amounts, it may suggest that the underwriting requirements for females might not be as predictive of their specific mortality drivers as they are for males.\n2.  **Stagnation in Medical Advancements:** The lack of a steep decline in some segments might reflect the \"law of diminishing returns\" in mortality improvement, where the easy gains from smoking cessation and basic heart health have already been realized.\n3.  **Measurement Error (VBT Baseline):** If the underlying VBT2015 table (the \"Expected\" denominator) was already very aggressive for females, it makes further \"improvements\" in the A/E ratio harder to achieve compared to males, who may have had more \"room\" for improvement."

Analysis of the Trend\nThe graph does not show a steady \"improvement\" (which would be a consistent downward slope); instead, it exhibits significant **volatility** with a potential regime shift toward the end of the period.\n\n*   **2012\u20132014 (Sharp Deterioration):** There is a steep increase in the A/E ratio, peaking in 2014 at nearly 1.08. This suggests that for these three years, smokers were dying at a rate significantly higher than the 2015 VBT (Valuation Basic Table) expectations.\n*   **2014\u20132016 (Improvement):** A steady decline occurred, bringing the ratio down to approximately 1.03.\n*   **2017 Spikes:** There is a notable \"rebound\" spike in 2017. In mortality studies, single-year spikes are often attributed to external factors like a particularly severe flu season, which disproportionately affects high-risk respiratory groups (like smokers).\n*   **2018\u20132019 (Significant Improvement):** The most striking feature is the sharp drop in 2018 and 2019, with 2019 falling below 1.00 for the first time in the observed period.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Your Hypothesis\n**Hypothesis Status: Partially Disproven by Recent Data.**\n\nYour hypothesis suggested that smoker mortality would remain **stagnant or deteriorate** in later years (2017\u20132019) due to a \"population shift\" toward a higher-risk subset.\n*   **The Support:** The spike in 2017 supports the idea of continued high risk and volatility.\n*   **The Contradiction:** The data for 2018 and especially 2019 contradicts the \"stagnation\" theory. The drastic drop to an A/E ratio below 0.99 in 2019 suggests that either the \"population shift\" is being offset by other factors, or the smoker segment is finally experiencing the lagged benefits of modern medical interventions/cessation programs.\n\n### 3. New Insights and Speculations\n\n#### A. The \"Healthy Smoker\" Re-selection (Self-Selection Bias)\nWhile overall smoking prevalence is declining, the smokers who *continue* to carry life insurance (and pay the significantly higher smoker premiums) may be higher socioeconomic status individuals who, despite smoking, have better access to healthcare and screenings for smoking-related illnesses (cancer/heart disease) than the general smoker population. This could explain the 2019 dip.\n\n#### B. The \"Face Amount\" Influence (Anti-Selection)\nThe graph tracks A/E by **Amount**. A few large death claims in the Smoker segment can cause the volatility seen in 2014 and 2017.\n*   **Speculation:** Smoker policies often have lower face amounts on average. However, if there was a spike in \"Jumbo\" smoker claims in 2014/2017, it would disproportionately inflate the ratio. The drop in 2019 might reflect a lack of large-claim volatility rather than a fundamental change in base mortality rates.\n\n#### C. Data Dictionary Clue: The 2018 Change\nThe Data Dictionary notes: *\"Observation Year 2018+: Face Amount is assigned at the segment level.\"*\n*   **Insight:** The sharp drop in A/E starting in 2018 coincides exactly with this change in how Face Amount is reported. This suggests the \"improvement\" in 2018\u20132019 might be partially **structural or administrative**. If the new reporting method changed the denominator (Expected Deaths - Amount) or how claims are allocated to the \"Smoker\" segment versus \"Riders,\" it could artificially depress the A/E ratio compared to the 2012\u20132017 methodology.\n\n#### D. The Impact of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)\nThe 2012\u20132019 period saw the rise of vaping.\n*   **Speculation:** Some \"Smokers\" in the later data years may be former combustible cigarette users who switched to vaping. While still classified as \"Smoker\" for many insurance products, their short-term mortality risk (specifically cardiovascular and respiratory events) might be lower than long-term heavy combustible users, contributing to the 2019 decline.\n\n### Summary\nThe smoker segment is far more volatile than the non-smoker segment generally is. While your hypothesis regarding stagnation was logical, the **2019 data point is a significant outlier** that suggests either an acceleration in mortality improvement among smokers or, more likely, a shift in data reporting/segmentation (per the 2018 Face Amount change) that warrants closer investigation at the policy level."

        "insight": "Based on the graph provided and the context of the ILEC (Individual Life Experience Committee) mortality data, here is an analysis of the trends, the underlying actuarial drivers, and a critique of your hypothesis.\n\n### 1. Verification of Hypothesis\nYour hypothesis is **largely supported** by the data, but with a few nuances regarding the \"improvement\" in the PLT segment:\n\n*   **WLT (Within Level Term):** Your expectation of consistent mortality improvement is correct. The A/E ratio shows a steady, almost linear decline from approximately 0.88 in 2012 to roughly 0.75 by 2019. \n*   **PLT (Post-Level Term):** Your hypothesis regarding significantly higher mortality and volatility is confirmed. The A/E ratios for PLT are nearly **double** those of the WLT segment (ranging from 1.55 to 1.78). This confirms the presence of extreme anti-selection.\n\n### 2. New Insights and Trends\n*   **The Convergence/Stabilization of PLT (2014\u20132019):** After a sharp spike in 2014, the PLT segment actually shows a gradual *downward* trend in A/E ratios. While still much higher than WLT, this suggests that the industry may be getting better at managing the \"shock lapse\" period or that the mix of business entering the post-level phase is changing (e.g., more \"step-up\" premium designs vs. \"cliffs\").\n*   **Resilience of WLT Improvement:** The WLT segment shows no volatility. This suggests that for policyholders still within their guaranteed period, the underlying mortality improvements (medical advancements, etc.) are being captured effectively by the VBT2015 tables, and the actual experience is consistently or even increasingly favorable relative to the expected.\n*   **The 2014 PLT Anomaly:** There is a distinct peak for PLT in 2014. This could indicate a specific cohort of 10-year or 15-year term policies issued during a period of aggressive underwriting (early 2000s) reaching their level-premium end dates simultaneously.\n\n### 3. Speculation on Drivers (Specifying \"Why\")\n\n**High PLT (Post-Level Term) Mortality:**\n*   **Anti-Selection (The \"Sick Survivor\" Effect):** At the end of a level term period, premiums typically jump by 500% to 2,000%. Healthy policyholders lapse or buy new policies (re-entering a \"WLT\" or \"Select\" phase). Only those who are uninsurable or in poor health\u2014who know they cannot get coverage elsewhere\u2014are willing to pay the massive premium spike to keep the coverage. This results in a \"closed block\" of high-risk individuals.\n*   **Policy Design:** Older term products often had a \"shock lapse\" design. Newer products may have \"graded\" premium increases which might eventually smooth this volatility, but the data here primarily reflects the older \"cliff\" structures.\n\n**Lower and Improving WLT (Within-Level Term) Mortality:**\n*   **Preferred Underwriting Evolution:** During the observation years (2012\u20132019), the industry saw a refinement in automated underwriting and the use of better laboratory data. Policyholders in the WLT segment are still benefiting from the \"Select\" period of their mortality.\n*   **Socioeconomic Factors:** Term life insurance buyers, specifically those in the WLT segment, often correlate with higher socioeconomic status, which is historically linked to better health outcomes and access to medical care compared to the general population.\n\n### 4. Actuarial Implications\n*   **Table Suitability:** The fact that WLT is consistently below 1.0 (averaging ~0.8) suggests that the VBT2015 (Valuation Basic Table) might be slightly conservative for the modern \"Within-Level\" term population, or that the market is shifted toward more \"Preferred\" risks than the table assumes.\n*   **Pricing for the Jump:** The PLT ratios (1.6+) demonstrate why carriers must price \"post-level\" premiums so aggressively. If the A/E ratio is that high, the premium must compensate for a population that is effectively \"Select\" in reverse\u2014they are staying because they expect to claim.\n\n### 5. Summary\nThe data confirms a **bi-furcated mortality reality** in the term market. The WLT segment is the \"engine of profit\" with improving and predictable mortality, while the PLT segment serves as a \"residual risk pool\" where the mortality is nearly 100% higher due to the economic incentive for healthy lives to exit the pool."
