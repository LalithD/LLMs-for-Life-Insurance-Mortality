# LLMs for Life Insurance Mortality

This repository contains code to demonstrate a simple example of using LLMs as part of an agentic AI workflow to perform end-to-end exploratory data analysis on a life insurance mortality dataset.

We used Gemini 3 Flash through the OpenRouter API.

The final LLM analysis is saved in the following markdown files:
- `idea1.md`
- `idea2.md`
- `idea3.md`
- `idea4.md`

Run `llm_for_mortality_analysis_full_workflow.ipynb` to recreate the outputs. Make sure to update the API key at the beginning of the notebook.
